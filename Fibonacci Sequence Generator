# 6. Fibonacci Sequence Generator:
# â€¢ Hints:
#     1. Initialize two variables with the first two numbers of the Fibonacci sequence (0 and 1).
#     2. Use a loop to generate the next number in the sequence by adding the last two numbers.
#     3. Store the generated numbers in a list and print the list.

first_num = 0
second_num = 1

Fibonacci_Sequence = []

while first_num < 100:
  Fibonacci_Sequence.append(first_num)
  new_num = first_num + second_num  # Calculate the next Fibonacci number
  first_num = second_num  # Update first_num with the old value of second_num
  second_num = new_num  # Update second_num with the newly calculated number
  print(Fibonacci_Sequence)
