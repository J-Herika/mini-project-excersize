learning by doing small python projects everyday

I'm on a journey to learn Python, but I want to do more than just watch tutorials.
So, I've made a personal commitment to create one simple project every day.
I'm doing this not only to practice my Python skills but also to keep myself motivated.
I've decided to share my progress here on GitHub to hold myself accountable, ensuring I don't skip a day.
But it's not just about me. I hope that by sharing my daily projects, I can inspire and motivate others who might be in the same position as I am. .

Let's code and inspire each other!

Warm regards.
